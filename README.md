# My React + TypeScript App (Built with Vite)

Welcome to my project! This app is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It's a modern and scalable starter template designed to make building apps faster and easier. The folder structure and design follow industry best practices.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s a summary of the `src/` directory and its purpose:

```plaintext
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/       # Static files like images, fonts, and videos
â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs, modals)
â”œâ”€â”€ containers/   # Page-level components combining multiple UI elements
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/     # App-wide state (e.g., theme, auth) using React Context
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        # Custom hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useAuth, useFetch)
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/      # Shared layouts like headers, footers, and sidebars
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/       # App routing and protected routes
â”œâ”€â”€ services/     # API calls and backend integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ store/        # Global state management (e.g., Redux or Zustand setup)
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/       # Global and utility styles (CSS or Tailwind)
â”œâ”€â”€ types/        # TypeScript types and interfaces for type safety
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Helper functions (e.g., formatDate, validateEmail)
```

### Why This Structure?

- **Scalable**: Keeps code maintainable as your app grows.
- **Reusable**: Makes it easy to share components, hooks, and utilities.
- **Clear Separation**: Divides concerns (e.g., UI, state, services) for cleaner code.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Dev Server

Launch the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Explore the App

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements.
- **Services**: Handles backend logic and API calls.
- **Store**: Manages global state like user data or settings.
- **Layouts**: Defines shared structures like headers and footers.

### Build for Production

Create an optimized production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be located in the `dist/` folder.

## âœ¨ Benefits of This Setup

- **Speed**: Vite ensures fast development with instant reloads.
- **Clean Codebase**: Logical folder organization for maintainable code.
- **Reusability**: Components, hooks, and utilities can be reused throughout the app.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle both small and large-scale applications.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches bugs early and ensures better code quality.
